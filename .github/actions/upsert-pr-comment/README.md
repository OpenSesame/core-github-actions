# Upsert PR Comment Action

## 🧭 Summary

Creates or updates a comment on a GitHub Pull Request. The comments are identified by a unique
hidden marker. This ensures only one comment per marker is present, updating the comment if one
already exists for the marker or creating a new one if not.

## Scope/Limitations

- Supports upserting comments on an open PR in any repository where the action is used.
- Only works for PRs (not issues or other event types).
- Requires a GitHub token with appropriate permissions.
- The marker must be unique per comment type to avoid accidental overwrites.

## 🔒 Permissions

The following GitHub Actions permissions are required:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

## Dependencies

- Uses `actions/github-script@v7`
- Uses the GitHub REST API
- Runs on any GitHub-hosted runner

  with:

      ## PR Scan Results
      - All checks passed!
```

## 🧠 Notes

- The comment marker is embedded as an HTML comment and should be unique for each comment type you
  want to upsert.
- If multiple workflows use the same marker, they will overwrite each other's comments.
- The action uses the GitHub REST API to list, update, or create comments.

## Versioning

This action uses namespaced tags for versioning and is tracked in the repository CHANGELOG.
