# Run Semgrep Action

## 🧭 Summary

Runs a Semgrep scan normalizing the baseline for diff scans depending on push vs PR context. Outputs scan results and summaries for downstream steps.

## Scope/Limitations

- Supports both push and pull request events.
- Runs on the GitHub Actions Node.js 24 runtime.
- Requires Semgrep to be installed and available in the runner environment.
- Expects environment variables for configuration (see below).

## 🔒 Permissions

The following GHA permissions are required to use this step:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

## Dependencies

- `semgrep` — must be installed in the runner environment.
- `https` — standard Node.js module for API requests included in default action runners
- `reviewdog` — for annotation output (optional, for downstream steps).

## 🚀 Usage

Basic usage example:

```yaml
- name: Run Semgrep
  id: semgrep
  uses: OpenSesame/core-github-actions/.github/actions/run-semgrep@actions/run-semgrep/1.0.0
  env:
    HAS_PR: ${{ env.HAS_PR }}
    INPUT_BASELINE: ${{ env.INPUT_BASELINE }}
    GITHUB_EVENT_NAME: ${{ github.event_name }}
    GITHUB_REF_NAME: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
    SEMGREP_CONFIG: 'p/default'
    SEMGREP_TARGETS: '.'
    SCAN_MODE: 'full'
    FAIL_LEVEL: 'error'
    EXTRA_ARGS: ''
```

Example outputs:

```yaml
steps.semgrep.outputs.scanStatus
steps.semgrep.outputs.totalFindings
```

Example usage of outputs in later steps:

```yaml
if: steps.semgrep.outputs.scanStatus == 'failure'
  run: echo "Semgrep scan failed at or above threshold."
```

## 🧠 Notes

- This action writes a file for reviewdog annotations (`reviewdog_input.txt`).
- Unit tests for the script are included in `run-semgrep.unit.test.js` (not used by the action, but kept for maintainability).

## Versioning

This action uses namespaced tags for versioning and is tracked in the CHANGELOG.

```text
actions/run-semgrep/vX.Y.Z
```

See the repository's versioning documentation for details on how tags are validated and created.
