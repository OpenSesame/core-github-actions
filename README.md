# Core Github Actions

The Core Services team uses GitHub Actions to standardize our CI/CD process.

## ‚ùå Deprecation Notice: Composite Actions

An earlier version of the 'Core' team wrote composite actions in this repository to provide a standardized way for teams to build, test, and deploy software.
These actions have not been actively maintained in years and are considered deprecated by the current Core Services team.

* [build](./build)
* [build-apply](./build-apply)
* [build-publish](./build-publish)
* [cleanup](./cleanup)
* [deploy](./deploy)
* [tf-apply](./tf-apply)
* [tf-plan](./tf-plan/)
* [tf-plan-comment](./tf-plan-comment/)

### Why deprecated

 1. They hide important pipeline details making it difficult for engineers to understand or troubleshoot CI/CD pipelines.
 2. They have accumulated technical debt and do not reflect our current best practices.

### What we're doing instead

The Core Services team is writing a standard set of reusable workflows defined in this same repository for use by our repos. This approach improves visibility, reduces hidden complexity, and ensures pipelines follow current standards.  

### Maintenance ownership of the old composite actions

* Use of these composite actions is **at your own risk**.  
* The Core Services team will not maintain them.  
* If your team still relies on them, we are happy to make you `CODEOWNER` for the relevant directories.  

### Migration options
  
* Copy the composite action code directly into your workflow in place of calling the composite action.
* Consider writing your own reusable GHA or discuss with us ways to make ours more widely adoptable and maintainable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Versioning Warning

Nothing in this repo is currently versioned. Changes here affect **all consumers immediately**. Make changes carefully and aim for passivity to avoid breaking existing workflows.

## Testing

To test changes before merging into main:

1. Create a feature branch and make your changes.
2. Push the branch to GitHub.
3. Update a consuming repo‚Äôs workflow to reference your branch and push to GitHub.
   For example, if you are working on branch `feature/CORE-123`:

    ```yaml
    uses: opensesame/core-github-actions/build-apply@feature/CORE-123
    ```

The same approach can be used for referencing feature branch versions of the reusable workflows.

## üöÄ NEW Reusable Workflow

The Core Services team is moving away from composite actions and building **reusable workflows** in this repository.

### Why reusable workflows?

Reusable workflows make pipelines more transparent:

* Engineers see each build, lint, and test step clearly in the GitHub Actions run log.  
* Hidden complexity is reduced ‚Äî no more ‚Äúmagic‚Äù buried inside composite actions.  

### Current scope

At this stage, the reusable workflows support **Terraform-only projects**.

### Roadmap

* Expand reusable workflows to support repositories that require code build steps.  
* Iterate toward the right patterns for publishing workflows that handle more complex pipelines.  

### Interim approach

Until broader reusable workflows are available:

* We are **inlining the old composite action code directly into workflows** in our repos.
* This makes pipelines explicit and easier to debug, while buying time to design maintainable patterns for future workflows.
